* In 1906, a young scholar, Ganapathi Shastri from TambaraBarani near Chennai discovered a set of manuscripts in Travancore & was awestruck
* These were the works of Mahakavi Bhasa the whole world was searching for
* These were the 13 Trivandrum plays which were in Sanskrit language but written in Malayalam
* The young scholar worked on these scripts for 3 years & in 1912 published them in Sanskrit & the whole world was shaken by this discovery
* Why the world was waiting for it?
  * The great Kalidasa had reffered in his very first work - How anyone who has seen Bhasa would ev er be interested in my play?
  * This shows how Bhasa was already a well renowned poet, but none of his works had survived the milleniums
  * It was still played by the Chakyars like Urubhangam, Karnabharam etc without knowing that this was by Mahakavi Bhasa
  * So a great gratitude is owed to Ganapathi Shastri
* Bhasa wrote 13 plays, more than a lot of his

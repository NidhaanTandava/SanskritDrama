* In 1906, a young scholar, Ganapathi Shastri from TambaraBarani near Chennai discovered a set of manuscripts in Travancore & was awestruck
* These were the works of Mahakavi Bhasa the whole world was searching for
* These were the 13 Trivandrum plays which were in Sanskrit language but written in Malayalam
* The young scholar worked on these scripts for 3 years & in 1912 published them in Sanskrit & the whole world was shaken by this discovery
* Why the world was waiting for it?
  * The great Kalidasa had reffered in his very first work - How anyone who has seen Bhasa would ev er be interested in my play?
  * This shows how Bhasa was already a well renowned poet, but none of his works had survived the milleniums
  * It was still played by the Chakyars like Urubhangam, Karnabharam etc without knowing that this was by Mahakavi Bhasa
  * So a great gratitude is owed to Ganapathi Shastri
* Bhasa wrote 13 plays, more than Kalidasa, Bhavabhuti, Harsha, Shudraka put together
* The Bhasa problem - how can the 13 plays be ascribed to Bhasa?
  * Kalidasa was placed in 5th century CE due to one of his plays that refers to Chandragupta 2 (Vikramaditya)
  * This was a golden period in Indian history & if Kalidasa was referring to Bhasa, Bhasa must be placed in 2nd or 3rd century CE
  * Ganapathi Shastri ascribes all the 13 plays to Bhasa, but in none of these plays in preface or anywhere Bhasa refers to himself
  * Rajasekara in 9th century had clearly states that though Svapnavasavadattam was burned, it could not be burnt by the fire. In that letter he ascribes Svapnavasavadattam as Bhasa's work
  * So out of the 10 discovered in the bunch, one is definitely of Bhasa. But what about the other 9?
  * Ganapathi Shastri did a detailed manuscriptual studies & textual criticism and came to conclusion & others are also of Bhasa:
    * In all these places,it starts with the same:
      > नान्द्यते ततः प्रविशति सूत्रधारः
    * All dramas by Kalidas, Harsha etc start with a Nandi (bendectory verse), the stage manager (SoothraDhara) presents the play to the spectators
    * But in Bhasa's play, the Nandi is played behind the curtain and then the stage manager enters
    * All the Kanchukis/Prathiharas (doorkeeper) name are the same in most of the plays
    * Similar sentences in all thes plays
    * Despite lot of evidence, many scholars opposed the authoship of Bhasa
* But what do we know of Bhasa?
  * From his dramas, there are so many allusions of Ujjaini, Kosambi, Kashi, Shravasthi
  * But then why were none of his works found in the North
  * It is theorised that as the North was under attack from the invaders, a lot of the work of scholars were destroyed
  * But in the south, where the invaders could not reach, it was preserved by the Chakyars, the oldest theatrical art form of India
  * Rajashekara in his KaviVimarsha beliefs that Bhasa was born in washerman's family
  * Many others think he is from a learned family
  * Now to date him, many think he was an older contemporary of Kalidas, but Ganapathi Shastri provides the following evidence:
    * Arthashastra of Kautilya belongs in the Maurya dynasty which was pre christian era
    * Here Kautilya mentions that he has borrowed one of the verse from an earlier author which is found in one of Bhasa's play
    * If so, Bhasa can be placed at 3rd or 4th century BCE

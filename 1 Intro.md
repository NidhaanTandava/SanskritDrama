Starts with an invocation to goddess Saraswathi, who is the overlord diety of literature, of speech, of Kavya, of Natya, of all the arts. 

Rajshekara, a great rhetorician & poetician, in his work [Kavyamimamsa](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/kavyamimamsa-of-rajasekhara-study) referred to Goddess Saraswathi as Sukthi-Denu(Cow that produces the milk of words-Su), whose milk is partaken by everyone, and is never empty. Let this Sukthi-Denu have a permanent place in our heart and bless us.

**Sahitya** (Saha + Ithi) -> Word + Meaning coming together, but is that definition sufficient. In different schools of Sanskrit, there are different meanings of what literature or Sahitya is.
* Bharata Muni in [Natyashastra](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-natyashastra) says that Sahitya is all about Rasa
* Bhamaha & Dhandin believe in Alankara
* [Vamana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acharya_Vamana) propounded the Riti philosophy
* Guna school
* Dhvani school

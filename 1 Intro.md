Starts with an invocation to goddess Saraswathi, who is the overlord diety of literature, of speech, of Kavya, of Natya, of all the arts. 

Rajshekara, a great rhetorician & poetician, in his work [Kavyamimamsa](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/kavyamimamsa-of-rajasekhara-study) referred to Goddess Saraswathi as Sukthi-Denu(Cow that produces the milk of words-Su), whose milk is partaken by everyone, and is never empty. Let this Sukthi-Denu have a permanent place in our heart and bless us.

**Sahitya** (Saha + Ithi) -> Word + Meaning coming together, but is that definition sufficient. In different schools of Sanskrit, there are different meanings of what literature or Sahitya is.
* Bharata Muni in [Natyashastra](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-natyashastra) says that Sahitya is all about Rasa
* Bhamaha & Dhandin believe in Alankara
* [Vamana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acharya_Vamana) propounded the Riti philosophy
* Guna school
* Dhvani school

But how did Literature/Poetry/Kavya come into existence?
* Since many of the poets were patronised by the kings, the sthuthi(panegyrics) could have been one of the reasons
* Another theory is Love, which inspired Kavyam driven by Shringara
* The heroics of the kings (VeeraGatha, ShouryaGatha) was told by their bards

### Scope of OLA Sahitya Course

Can the Vedas be called Literature?
* It is not Sahitya as it is Apourusheya. Because it is considered as revelation it is not considered as literature.

Then is Ramayana/Mahabharatha Sahitya?
* It is considered as Ithihasa, although Ramayana is considered as AdhiKavya & Valmiki as AdhiKavi
* In Mahabharatha too, there is beautiful poetics
* But since it was not composed as a literary piece to be relished by the Rasikas, these are not considered for this course

So what is covered if the Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, Ithihasas are removed. Professor talks about an old wise man who was asked that he must have knowledge about a lot of things to which he replied:

> मेघ माघे गतं वयः

*I spent my entire life in Megadhutha & Maga's Shishupala Vadha*

So as it was impossible to cover the vast corpus of Sanskrit literature, 14 gems of Sanskrit literature & their works were picked up for this course:
1. Bhasa (4th Century BCE)
   * Panini (~5th Century BC) & Patanjali (~1st Century BC)
   * Patanjali refers to Panini, but not Bhasa
   * Prevalent theory is that Bhasa's works were destroyed as he stood up against the Yavanas after the time of Itihasas
   * His work was preserved in South India by Chakyars through Kutiyattam, the oldest form of theatrical form
   * No northern rescensions of Bhasa's plays
   * That is why Patanjali who was in North could not refer to Bhasa
  
2. Shudraka
   * Jana kavi
   * He stands for the common people
   * Mṛcchakatika will be covered where he covers the story of very common people like thief, vaishya, daasi

   * Banabhatta, Dhandi stands for Gadya Kavya(GV)
   * GV is difficult & Banabhatta excels in it

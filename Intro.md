Starts with an invocation to goddess Saraswathi, who is the overlord diety of literature, of speech, of Kavya, of Natya, of all the arts. 

Rajshekara, a great rhetorician & poetician, in his work [Kavyamimamsa](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/kavyamimamsa-of-rajasekhara-study) referred to Goddess Saraswathi as Sukthi-Denu(Cow that produces the milk of words-Su), whose milk is partaken by everyone, and is never empty. Let this Sukthi-Denu have a permanent place in our heart and bless us.
